1) figure out a way to compare locations.
both playground_equiptment.csv and city_of_pgh_pools.csv use "neighborhood" as a location - so we can cross check neighborhoods using names i think.
permitted_shelters doesn't have neighborhoods - it has locations. we can make a csv which crossreferences the permitted_shelters location with the neighborhoods ??

for shelters:
1) find out how many shelters matches up with each location
2) make spreadsheet of number of shelters per location
3) find out what neighborhood is in each location
4) plot by number of shelters per location!
