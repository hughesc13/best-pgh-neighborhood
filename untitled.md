To identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on public recreation facilities, our team developed a point-based system. We assigned points based on the number of playgrounds (1 point each), shelters (5 points each), and pools (10 points each). This scoring method enabled us to fairly compare neighborhoods by weighing different types of amenities according to their significance and availability.
In our project, Highland Park ranked as the top neighborhood for recreational amenities, with a total of 85 points. This is largely due to its high number of shelters (11) and balanced presence of pools (2) and playgrounds (10). This combination shows that Highland Park excels in multiple areas, offering diverse and plentiful recreational resources for the community, and it is an ideal place for families, group gatherings, and individual leisure activities.
This scoring method gave our team a fair, data-driven way to reconcile different findings and reach a shared conclusion to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
